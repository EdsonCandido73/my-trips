## :memo: Description
My-trips is an interactive platform that allows users to record their travels around the world and create a personalized map with markers representing the places they have visited. By clicking on a marker on the map, a detailed page of the chosen location is displayed, containing photos and descriptions provided by the user.

## :books: How it works
* You will be able to register your places in a CMS, including a description, interesting facts, etc., and upload photos. The location will be added to the interactive map.
